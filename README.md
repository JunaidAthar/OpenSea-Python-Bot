# OpenSea-Python-Bot
OpenSea Python Bot can be used in 2 modes. When --nft parameter is passed, it will allow you to continuously monitor an NFT project and automatically snipe/buy if the price of the NFT is 50% or lower than it's floor value. If the price of the NFT is 20-40% below it's floor, then the bot can send a notification on Discord or print the result on-screen. The script can also be used to buy a specific NFT by passing the --url parameter. In that case the bot will automatically  buy the NFT at its current price value
